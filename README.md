# Airthings Bluetooth Sensor

This library enables programs to read information provided by Airthings sensors over the Bluetooth Low Energy protocol. The protocol Airthings uses doesn't appear to be published anywhere, so it uses [a sample Python script](https://github.com/Airthings/waveplus-reader/blob/master/read_waveplus.py) provided by the Airthings team to understand how to parse the sensor data payload.

This has currently only been tested with the Wave Plus sensor.
